This zip file contains four files:

- One .txt file with a list of all the urls for the files to download
- One .sh file which is a shell script that allow to download all files by
running the following command in UNIX systems:

./download_files.sh <downloaded_file_from_opendata_with_data_links.txt>

You will need to replace the text between '<' and '>' with the provided .txt
file.

Optionally you can do:

./download_files.sh <downloaded_file_from_opendata_with_data_links.txt> download_folder

And this will download all the files into the specified download_folder. If no download_folder
is provided then the files will be downloaded to a folder named 'downloaded_files' in the
current working directory.

- A tsv file with the metadata corresponding to the downloaded files (in .txt
file) in this zip.
